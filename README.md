# TinyTank
A recreation of an old scratch game of mine called Tiny Tank, this time with built with Love2D! Play the original here: (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/82253834/)

Fight your way through a series of levels with intelligent AI and try not to die!
This game also features circle VS rectangle collision for the player/AI VS walls.

### How to run:
- Make sure you have the [Love2D Lua framework](https://love2d.org/) installed
- Download this repository
- Unzip the .zip and you should have a folder, enter it and rezip all the *contents* of said folder (not the folder)
- Rename the game.zip into game.love and double click it to run. If all has gone well, it should open as a game.

alternatively after step one you can download the .love from the repositorys release page [here](https://github.com/Dot32IsCool/TinyTank-Love2D-Game/releases)
